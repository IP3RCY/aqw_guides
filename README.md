# aqw_guides

A new web application containing the files for all my previously created AQWorlds-related web apps and all subsequent AQWorlds statistics apps to be created in the future.

These are the guides the application currently offers:

- **Drop Rate Guide**: Allows users to visualise in-game drop rate mechanics and the probabiity distribution of drops in AQWorlds.
- **Reputation Guide**: Allows users to view their in-game reputation statistics and track their reputation progress.
- **Void Aura Guide**: Allows users to estimate the total time required to reach 7,500 Void Auras.
